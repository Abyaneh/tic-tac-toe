# tic-tac-toe
 This is a C++ implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game is played between two users where each player chooses a number, either "X" or "O", and attempts to place it on a 4x4 grid. The first player to get three of their numbers in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game.
